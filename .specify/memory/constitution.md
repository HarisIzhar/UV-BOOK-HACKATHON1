# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy First
All robotics, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and AI concepts must be technically correct and industry-aligned. Every technical statement, code example, and simulation must be verified for correctness and aligned with current industry standards and best practices.

### Learn-by-Building
Every concept should be reinforced with practical examples, code snippets, or simulations. Theoretical explanations must be paired with hands-on implementations that readers can execute and experiment with to solidify understanding.

### Simulation-to-Real Mindset
Emphasize sim-to-real transfer, hardware constraints, and deployment realities. All examples should consider the gap between simulation environments and real-world deployment, addressing practical considerations for transitioning from simulated to physical systems.

### Open-Source Friendly
All examples must use open standards and tools (ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo, Isaac ROS). Proprietary or closed-source solutions should be avoided in favor of accessible, community-supported alternatives that students can freely access and experiment with.

### Progressive Complexity
Begin with foundational Physical AI concepts and progress toward full humanoid autonomy. Content should follow a logical progression from basic principles to advanced applications, ensuring each concept builds appropriately on prior knowledge.

### Reproducibility
Steps, commands, and configurations should be reproducible on Ubuntu 22.04. All examples, tutorials, and code snippets must be tested and validated on the target platform to ensure consistent student experiences.

### Student-Centered
Written for advanced AI/CS students transitioning into robotics. Content should assume appropriate prerequisite knowledge while providing sufficient context and support for students making the transition from digital AI to embodied systems.

## Additional Constraints

Technology Stack Requirements:
- Target Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Primary Framework: ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
- Simulation Environment: Gazebo Garden or Isaac SIM
- Programming Languages: Python 3.10+, C++
- Hardware Compatibility: Focus on widely available platforms (Unitree, Boston Dynamics spot simulators, etc.)

Content Standards:
- University-level depth and rigor
- Capstone-quality technical accuracy
- Practical implementation focus
- Industry-relevant examples and use cases

## Development Workflow

Quality Gates:
- Technical accuracy verification by subject matter experts
- Code example testing on target platform
- Simulation environment validation
- Peer review by robotics educators
- Student usability testing for clarity and comprehension

Review Process:
- All content must undergo technical review
- Code examples must be executable and produce documented results
- Simulations must be validated for realism and educational value
- Hardware recommendations must be current and accessible

## Governance

This constitution serves as the governing document for all project activities. All specifications, plans, and tasks must align with these principles. Any deviation requires explicit justification and approval. Content development must prioritize technical accuracy, practical applicability, and educational effectiveness as defined by these core principles.
