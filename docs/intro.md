# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Brains to Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on robotics, AI, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. This book covers everything from foundational concepts to advanced implementations of embodied artificial intelligence.

## Book Overview

This book teaches Physical AI and embodied intelligence concepts to senior undergraduate and graduate students in AI, Robotics, and Computer Science. You will learn to build simulated autonomous humanoid robots by integrating Vision-Language-Action systems using LLMs.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Create and simulate robotic systems in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- Utilize NVIDIA Isaac for perception and control tasks
- Implement locomotion and manipulation behaviors for humanoid robots
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems using LLMs
- Build a fully autonomous humanoid robot as a capstone project

### Technical Tools You'll Master

This book covers the following core technical tools:
- **ROS 2**: The robotic nervous system for communication and control
- **Gazebo & Unity**: Simulation environments for robot testing
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: Platform for perception and control with hardware acceleration
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems**: Multimodal AI integration

## Course Structure

This book follows a 13-week academic quarter curriculum with progressive complexity:

7. **Week 13**: [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot](./week13-capstone-integration.md) - System Integration & Deployment

## Getting Started

This book uses a "learn-by-building" approach where you'll follow along with code examples, architecture diagrams, and practical exercises throughout each chapter. Each chapter includes:
- Concept explanations with clear, accessible language
- Architecture diagrams and system flow descriptions
- Complete, tested code examples in Python, ROS 2, and launch files
- Practical exercises with specific deliverables
- Progressive complexity that builds on previous concepts

Begin with [Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI](./week1-intro-physical-ai.md) to start your journey in embodied artificial intelligence.
