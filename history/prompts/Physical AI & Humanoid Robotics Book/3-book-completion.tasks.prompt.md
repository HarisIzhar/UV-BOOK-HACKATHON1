Physical AI represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI that operates on abstract data to AI that operates in physical environments with real-world constraints. The key principles you've mastered include:

### Embodied Cognition
- Intelligence emerges from the dynamic interaction between brain, body, and environment
- The physical form influences cognitive processes
- Complex behaviors emerge from simple body-environment interactions

### Real-World Constraints
- Operating under real-time constraints and dynamics
- Managing uncertainty in sensing and actuation
- Working within the bounds of physical laws (gravity, friction, momentum)

### Perception-Action Integration
- Continuous perception-action loops that enable adaptive behavior
- Real-time processing and response to environmental changes
- Closed-loop control systems that maintain stability and performance

## Vision-Language-Action Systems

The culmination of your learning centers on VLA (Vision-Language-Action) systems - the next frontier in robotics:

### Multimodal Integration
- Combining visual perception, language understanding, and action execution
